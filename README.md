Flight Passengers Satisfaction Model : Classification Machine Learning Model
1. Itâ€™s a dynamic data with 24 features of about 1.5 lakh passengers.
2. The target of the study is whether the passenger is satisfied or not with
services provided during his/her journey.
3. While working on the data, performed EDA (Checked for missing values,
Outlier treatment, Categorical Encoding, Data Preparation, Data
Normalization, Train-Test-Split)
4. Performed Feature Selection & Elimination method.
5. Used various ML Algorithms like LR, DTC, RFC, SVM & evaluated their
performance to find the best predictive model for the Aviation Data.
6. Random Forest Classifier performs best with the given data.
7. Explained in detailed about the various evaluations & various model performances
with respect to data in ppt.
